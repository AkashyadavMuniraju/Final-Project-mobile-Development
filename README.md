About the Project:
Cinemagic is a mobile app designed for movie enthusiasts, offering an engaging platform to discover, explore, and keep track of movies. Users can browse current releases, popular films, and top-rated movies, view detailed information, and maintain a personalized list of favorites. The app utilizes The Movie Database (TMDB) API for movie data and integrates features like in-app notifications, a location-based movie theater finder, and dark mode. Cinemagic is built with a user-friendly interface to provide a seamless movie exploration experience and stays up-to-date with the latest cinematic content.

Nearby Theaters Locator: Uses Google Maps SDK to show movie theaters near the user's current location, with pins for each theater and directions available via Google Maps.
